# HorseRecords

Program was made to store horse information. 
It's written to a .csv file through the main function 
(the output file is not fed through any other functions yet).

The program opens the output file, checks to see if the output file
is present, and terminates if it's not there. Then the program uses
the inputName function to get the name of a horse from the user. It 
writes the new name to the output file and then prints to the screen
that the info has been written.
